It has since then also been applied to problems including the generalization of results of observational studies, and to data fusion.  \n",

    "The operations, or rules, of do-calc are applied sequentially to a graph.  They involve first imagining that a treatment or exposure variable is set to a particular value (the \"do\" part), and then modifying the graph to create a series of conditional independencies between Y (one or more outcome variables) and one or more sets of confounding Z's.\n",
